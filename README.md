## Note
- As a team, we believe that this checkpoint went well. We were able to begin familiarizing ourselves with the equiptment (MIDI Keyboard)
and started developing a low to mid fidelity environment in Unity for our immersive experience. While we were unable to showcase the low fidelity environment
via video at this stage, we plan to provide it as a follow up or at the next checkpoint. Thank you!
